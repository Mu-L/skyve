# Contributing to Skyve

Skyve is free and open source and we always are excited to receive contributions from our community. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials, providing translations into new languages, improving the documentation or writing code to fix bugs or add new features to the platform itself.

## Issues and Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by creating a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/skyvers/skyve/issues/new/choose).

If you have a question on using or getting started with a Skyve project, please see our [Getting Started](https://skyve.org/getting-started) page and watch the videos, follow the [tutorial](https://skyvers.github.io/Aged-care/), use the [skyve tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/skyve) or join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/skyveframework/shared_invite/enQtNDMwNTcyNzE0NzI2LTRkMWUxZDBlZmFlMmJkMjQzYWMzYWQxMmQzYWQ1ZTdlODNkNjRlYzVhYjFmMmQ4NTlhYWY4MjNhMGVkZGNlMjY).

## Feature Requests

If there is something you feel is missing from Skyve, we want to hear your ideas. We are constantly trying to improve the platform to make it as versatile as possible, and many of the features in Skyve exist because our users saw a need. 

Create a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/skyvers/skyve/issues/new/choose) which describes the feature, how it would be useful to you, and how it should work. The core team will discuss with you in the issue, and if you would like to contribute you can then start working on a Pull Request.

## Skyve Development Setup
